          So far, it's been a great experience. The teachers are amazing — they truly know how to teach, and it makes all the difference.
          I'm currently studying Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Maths, and Statistics.
          My favorite subject is Biology because it's engaging and well-taught, while Physics has been the most challenging for me.
          Overall, I'm really enjoying my studies and feel supported by the teaching staff.

          I joined the academy for 6 months now. Ever since I joined, it's been a good experience.
          All teachers are good, they teach well & help me improve.
          My grades and subjects I take are Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Statistics.
          My favourite subject is Maths because it's an interesting subject for me.

        <p>
          Joined Leaders for about 5–6 months. I started late last year, as I was struggling in Maths, coming towards my IGCSE exams.
          I have highly improved in Maths ever since I joined LEC.
          The tutors help me greatly with my struggles and improved my marks.
          The trainers are very helpful. I find myself really comfortable around them.
          It's a good learning environment. They make me feel welcome and at ease,
          which makes it a great place to learn. I'm not afraid to make mistakes now,
          and I feel pretty confident. I would recommend Leaders to anyone who is struggling.

        <p>
          It’s really hard to begin because there are a lot of things.
          But the one thing I like in particular about all the teachers here is that they make summaries for me.
          They help me understand the big picture of my subject better, delving into deeper topics.
          I got more than what I expected from it.
